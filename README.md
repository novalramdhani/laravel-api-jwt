# Laravel API (with JWT authentication)

### What is JWT?
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519), and it represents a compact and self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Digital signature makes the data transmission via JWT trusted and verified. JWTs built upon the secret HMAC algorithm or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
